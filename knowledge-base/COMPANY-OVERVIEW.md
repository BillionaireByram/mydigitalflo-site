## Mission

To help business owners stop renting fragmented AI tools and start owning centralized AI infrastructure that runs their business.

## Vision

A world where every entrepreneur owns their AI — not rents it from 15 different SaaS companies.

## The Founder

**Byram Smith Jr.** went from running a full-service agency to building AI infrastructure that runs businesses on autopilot.

After years of watching entrepreneurs drown in fragmented tools, subscription fees, and "automation" that still required them to be the glue — he built something different.

My Digital Flo is the AI system he wished existed: one centralized brain that handles lead follow-up, client communication, scheduling, and operations — all owned by the client, not rented.

**Background:**
- Business & Leadership foundation
- Growth consultant experience
- AI automation specialist
- Built and scaled Digital Flo agency

## Our Evolution

### Phase 1: Agency
Started as Digital Flo — a branding & marketing agency serving entrepreneurs.

### Phase 2: SaaS (GHL White-Label)
Transitioned to white-labeling GoHighLevel as "My Digital Flo" platform. Good product, but adoption was the challenge.

### Phase 3: AI Infrastructure (Current)
Pivoted to done-for-you AI system builds. Same technology foundation, but positioned as infrastructure clients OWN rather than software they rent.
