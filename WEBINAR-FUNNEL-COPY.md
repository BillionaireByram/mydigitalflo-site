**Subtitle:** Founder of My Digital Flo | AI Infrastructure Architect

**Bio:**
```
Byram Smith Jr. went from running a full-service agency to building AI infrastructure that runs businesses on autopilot.

After years of watching entrepreneurs drown in fragmented tools, subscription fees, and "automation" that still required them to be the glue — he built something different.

My Digital Flo is the AI system he wished existed: one centralized brain that handles lead follow-up, client communication, scheduling, and operations — all owned by YOU, not rented from 15 different SaaS companies.

Today, he helps founders stop renting intelligence and start owning it.

## SECTION 5: URGENCY/CLOSE

**Header:** Ready To Stop Renting?

**Body:**
```
Every month you wait, you're paying $300-500 to rent intelligence you'll never own.

Your competitors are already building AI systems that work while they sleep.

The question isn't whether AI will run your business — it's whether YOU'LL own that AI or keep renting it from someone else.

This workshop shows you exactly how to make the switch.

One hour. One decision. Own your future.
