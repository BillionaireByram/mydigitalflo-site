## FUNNEL 1: VSL Funnel (Primary)

### Flow
```
Ad/Organic → Landing Page → VSL → CTA Button → Calendar Popup/Redirect → Booked Call
```

### Components Needed

#### 1. VSL Landing Page
- Headline that hooks
- VSL video embed (15-20 min max)
- CTA button below video
- Minimal distractions — no nav, no footer links
- Trust elements (logos, results, etc.) below fold

#### 2. VSL Script Structure
```
[0:00-1:00] HOOK
- Pattern interrupt
- "If you're running a business and still doing everything manually..."
- Call out the pain

[1:00-3:00] PROBLEM
- Fragmented tools ($300-500/month bleeding)
- You ARE the integration layer
- No real ownership of your systems
- Competition is already using AI

[3:00-5:00] AGITATE
- What happens if you don't fix this
- Lost leads, slow follow-up, burnout
- Your competition books while you sleep

[5:00-10:00] SOLUTION
- Introduce AVA / My Digital Flo
- One system, one brain, full ownership
- Walk through what it does (not how)
- Show the transformation

[10:00-12:00] PROOF
- Case studies / results
- "Here's what happened when..."
- Before/after

[12:00-14:00] OFFER
- What you get (done-for-you build)
- The 6 components
- What makes this different

[14:00-15:00] CTA
- "Book your strategy call"
- What happens on the call
- No pressure, just clarity
- Scarcity: limited builds per month
```

#### 3. CTA Mechanism
**Option A:** Popup modal with calendar embed (GHL)
**Option B:** Redirect to dedicated booking page
**Recommendation:** Popup — keeps them on page, reduces friction

#### 4. Calendar Integration
- GHL calendar link
- Embed or redirect
- Confirmation page with "what to expect" + pre-call video (optional)

## FUNNEL 2: Webinar Funnel (Secondary)

### Phase 1: Live Webinar
```
Ad/Organic → Registration Page → Confirmation + Add to Calendar → Live Webinar → Offer → Book Call
```

### Phase 2: Auto-Webinar (Evergreen)
```
Ad/Organic → Registration Page → Pick a Time → Watch Webinar → Offer → Book Call
```

### Phase 3: 3-Day Challenge (Future)
```
Ad/Organic → Challenge Registration → Day 1 (Problem) → Day 2 (Solution) → Day 3 (Offer) → Book Call
```

### Webinar Components Needed

#### 1. Registration Page
- Headline: "How to Stop Renting Intelligence and Finally Own Your AI System"
- What they'll learn (3 bullet points)
- Date/time (live) or "Pick your time" (auto)
- Simple form: Name, Email
- Countdown timer

#### 2. Webinar Structure (60-90 min)
```
[0:00-5:00] INTRO
- Who you are
- What we're covering
- Promise: "By the end, you'll know exactly..."

[5:00-20:00] CONTENT BLOCK 1: THE PROBLEM
- The AI trap (fragmented tools)
- Why most businesses fail at automation
- The hidden costs nobody talks about

[20:00-40:00] CONTENT BLOCK 2: THE SOLUTION
- The ownership model
- What a centralized AI system looks like
- Walk through AVA's capabilities
- Live demo or walkthrough

[40:00-55:00] CONTENT BLOCK 3: THE FRAMEWORK
- How to implement (high level)
- What changes in your business
- Results to expect

[55:00-70:00] THE OFFER
- What you get with MyDigitalFlo
- Done-for-you build
- Pricing/investment (or "apply for pricing")
- Bonuses (if any)
- Scarcity (limited spots)

[70:00-90:00] Q&A + CLOSE
- Answer questions
- Remind of offer
- Final CTA
```

#### 3. Follow-Up Sequence
- Replay email (24hr)
- "Did you have questions?" email (48hr)
- Case study email (72hr)
- Last chance email (5-7 days)
