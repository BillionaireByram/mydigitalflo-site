## SCENE 1: THE HOOK (0:00-0:15)

You're paying for AI...
```
*[glitch]*
```
...but you don't own any of it.
```

## SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:45)

**VISUAL:** Split screen chaos — multiple app windows, notifications pinging, browser tabs multiplying. Overwhelming. Stressful.

"You're not building a business. You're renting one. ChatGPT. Zapier. Your CRM. Email tools. Calendar apps. Fifteen different subscriptions... and NONE of them talk to each other."

**VISUAL:** Disconnected puzzle pieces floating in space. Red "X" marks appearing.

**VOICEOVER:**
"So who's the integration? Who's the glue holding it all together?"

**VISUAL:** Zoom into stressed entrepreneur at desk. Clock spinning fast.

One system.
One brain.
Yours.

**VOICEOVER:**
"No more duct-taping tools together. No more subscription bleeding. No more being the glue."

**VISUAL:** AVA avatar appears — friendly, futuristic, welcoming.

**VOICEOVER:**
"Meet AVA. Your AI operator. She handles your leads, books your calls, follows up with clients, and runs your operations... 24/7."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
```
While you sleep. While you scale. While you live.
```
